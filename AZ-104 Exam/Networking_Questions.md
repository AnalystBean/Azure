## QUESTION 1

Why would you use a content delivery network?



To ensure maximum uptime for an application that is hosted in more than one datacenter


For incoming traffic, to make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, such as URI path or host headers


** To better handle instantaneous high loads, such as the start of a product launch event **


To ensure requests made from users are securely handled and served


** To provide better performance and improved user experience for end users ""


A CDN keeps a recent copy of your web application and can deliver this much faster to users close to an endpoint. CDNs can handle a lot more data than a typical web server, which makes it ideal to handle traffic spikes as well. CDNs don't generally handle individual traffic routing rules, nor security.
